# 🌱 Fridays for Future Archive – Germany

Welcome to the **digital archive of the social movement Fridays for Future Germany**.  
This GitHub organization serves as a space to **collect, structure, and document internal processes, materials, and research** — contributing to self-reflection, movement history, and open knowledge.

## 🎯 Purpose & Vision

This organization aims to:

- **preserve internal knowledge and collective memory** of FFF Germany over the long term,  
- **document the structures, workflows, and learning processes** of the movement,  
- **foster transparency and participation**,  
- provide an **open research infrastructure** for activists, scholars, and educators.

The focus is not on public-facing communications, but on **internal traceability and protecting experiences** that might otherwise be lost.

## 📁 What’s archived here?

This organization may include several repositories, such as:

- `protocols`: Meeting notes from national plenaries, working group sessions, etc.  
- `structures`: Organizational charts, working group roles, decision-making processes.  
- `methods`: Tools, facilitation techniques, and process templates.  
- `timeline`: Chronology of key developments and turning points.  
- `research`: A space for analysis, research papers, and data-driven projects.

Anyone who is or was part of FFF Germany — or wants to contribute to the archive — is welcome to participate:

## 🔒 Data Protection & Ethics

We handle sensitive content with care and intention:

- No personal data without explicit consent  
- Internal materials only if there's a clear purpose for publication
